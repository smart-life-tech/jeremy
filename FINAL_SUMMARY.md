## Documentation Reading Path

**If you have 5 minutes:**
→ Read DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md

**If you have 30 minutes:**
→ Read DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md + COLOR_ALERT_REFERENCE.md

**If you have 1 hour:**
→ Above + README_IMPLEMENTATION.md

**If you have 2+ hours:**
→ All above + AIR_QUALITY_PRO_GUIDE.md + HA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

**If you're planning a business:**
→ Read everything + HARDWARE_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md

---

## Files to Edit for Your Use

### Customize These:
- **air_quality_pro.yaml**: Adjust alert thresholds if needed
- **COLOR_ALERT_REFERENCE.md**: Create customer-specific docs
- **HA automations**: Adapt to your devices (fans, lights, etc.)
- **Thresholds**: Calibrate to your environment/market

### Don't Need to Edit:
- **Sensor integration code**: Works as-is
- **Safety calculations**: Standards-based
- **HA entity creation**: Automatic discovery
- **Calibration logic**: Production-tested

---

## Support Structure Recommendations

1. Link them to COLOR_ALERT_REFERENCE.md (understanding)
2. Link them to HA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md (setup)
3. Create FAQ from common questions
4. Build HA automation templates they can import

### For Integrators
1. Provide complete AIR_QUALITY_PRO_GUIDE.md
2. Supply HARDWARE_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md for planning
3. Share SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md for understanding
4. Create custom automation templates for their HVAC

### For Future Self
1. Document any threshold changes in COLOR_ALERT_REFERENCE.md

---

## What's NOT Included (And Why)

**Not included:** Cloud services  
**Why:** Your market is HA enthusiasts who value privacy/local control  
**Optional:** Can add later if users request it

**Not included:** Mobile app  
**Why:** HA ecosystem already handles mobile notifications  
**Optional:** Can integrate HA Cloud or custom app later

**Not included:** PM2.5 sensors  
**Why:** Different technology, would add complexity  
**Option:** Plan as Tier 2 premium feature

**Not included:** Commercial certifications (UL, CE)  
**Why:** Not needed for DIY/home use  
**Plan:** Get if moving to commercial market (Tier 3)

---

## Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

Track these to validate market viability:
- **User satisfaction**: Target >4.5/5 stars
- **Sensor reliability**: Target 99%+ uptime
- **Calibration stability**: Target <5% drift/month
- **HA integration**: Target 100% of automations work
- **Support burden**: Target <1 issue per week
- **Repeat customers**: Track % for v2 planning

If these metrics are met after 3 months:
→ You have a viable product
→ Plan Tier 2 features + display upgrade

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Users don't understand alerts
**Mitigation:** COLOR_ALERT_REFERENCE.md + HA automations

### Risk: Calibration drifts
**Mitigation:** Automatic age tracking + periodic warnings

### Risk: Sensor failures
**Mitigation:** Data quality scoring alerts user to issues

### Risk: HA integration too complex
**Mitigation:** Auto-discovery + template automations

### Risk: Hardware limitations (backlight)
**Mitigation:** Documented workaround + upgrade path

### Risk: Market doesn't value 3-gas detection
**Mitigation:** Early user feedback -> adjust marketing

---
